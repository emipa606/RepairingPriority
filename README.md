Perhaps you want to keep a building repaired that is not part of your home area?
Perhaps you think it would be nice if your pawns repaired the base defenses before the dining chairs after challenging siege?

This mod lets you add and prioritize areas for repairing damaged buildings.
Its based on the mod [Cleaning Priority](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2018316486) by ChippedChaps.
